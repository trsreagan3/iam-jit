"""MCP (Model Context Protocol) server exposing iam-jit policy generation.

Lets any MCP-aware agent (Claude Code, Cursor, custom Claude SDK
builds, etc.) natively request scoped AWS IAM policies for specific
tasks. The agent describes what it needs to do; the server returns a
generated policy + risk score; the agent (or its orchestrator) decides
whether to attach the policy to a JIT-issued STS credential.

Architecture:
  agent → MCP request: { task, context, bias }
        ↓
  this server: validates input, calls generate_policy(), runs the
               output through the deterministic scorer
        ↓
  agent ← MCP response: { policy, risk_score, refinement_hints }

The server uses the stdio transport (one MCP server per CLI invocation,
typically spawned by the agent's MCP-host configuration). Stdio is the
simplest transport — no auth, no network, perfect for local
developer-facing agents.

Spec reference: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification

Implementation note: this is a MINIMAL JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio
implementation. We deliberately avoid pulling in heavy MCP SDK
dependencies — the protocol surface we need is tiny (one tool, no
prompts, no resources) and the spec is small. Going dependency-light
also keeps the iam-jit install footprint usable for environments
that don't want a full MCP SDK.

Run as:
  iam-jit mcp-server
  # OR
  python -m iam_jit.mcp_server

Usage in Claude Desktop / Code:
  Add to ~/.config/claude/mcp_settings.json:
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "iam-jit": {
        "command": "iam-jit",
        "args": ["mcp-server"]
